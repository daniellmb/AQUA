# AQUA: Automated QUality Analysis

## About

[AQUA](https://www.npmjs.org/package/aqua) improves front-end code by surfacing actionable metrics about JavaScript and CSS.

>AQUA raises the visibility of code quality and increases awareness within teams by giving immediate feedback about code smells before they become technical debt.

You are free to structure your projects anyway you like, and still take full advantage of AQUA. Simply create an `aqua.config.json` file that documents where things are.
